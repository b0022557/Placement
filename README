This is my placement application for assignment 3.


In VMware open up the terminal. 
Enter: 
git clone git@github.com:b0022557/Placement.git 
Once the project has cloned change directory to Placement. 
Enter: 
cd Placement/ 
Again change directory to Placement. 
Enter: 
cd Placement/ 
This will take you in Placement/Placement/. The grail-app will be within this Placement folder. Now run the grails-app. 
Enter: 
grails run-app 
Once the app has run a URL will appear to enter into an internet browser. Enter the URL to view the grails project. 
 
 
 
Enter the following URL into an internet browser. 
http://localhost:8080/Placement 
This will run my grails project and allow you to view my controllers.
